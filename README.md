Original Design of The Control Panel

I am using the control interface that I found in the building where I work. I work at South plains electric company and they have one elevator located in the center of the building. Attached below is the image of the panel.

The Issues of The Current Design

   While this isn't a horrible design it has a lot of room for improvement. The bottom row is too crowded and the color designs dont match correctly. On the left side it has blue indicating the open door button but on the right it only convers the symbol not the button which may lead to some confusion for the user.
   The buttons that are crowded at the bottom are buttons that aren't used very frequently are too close to the buttons that are used very freqeuently and it doesn't make sense to cram all of the buttons together when you have enough room to space out the buttons.
   Not only that, but since this elevator only has two floors you could make the design even better by making the buttons vertically rather than having them horizontally. This would make the design more simple and easier to follow.
