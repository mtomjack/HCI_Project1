Original Design of The Control Panel

I am using the control interface that I found in the building where I work. I work at South plains electric company and they have one elevator located in the center of the building. Attached below is the image of the panel.

Attached below is the gif of the panel.

The Issues of The Current Design

   While this isn't a horrible design it has a lot of room for improvement. The bottom row is too crowded and the color designs dont match correctly. On the left side it has blue indicating the open door button but on the right it only convers the symbol not the button which may lead to some confusion for the user.
   The buttons that are crowded at the bottom are buttons that aren't used very frequently are too close to the buttons that are used very freqeuently and it doesn't make sense to cram all of the buttons together when you have enough room to space out the buttons.
   Not only that, but since this elevator only has two floors you could make the design even better by making the buttons vertically rather than having them horizontally. This would make the design more simple and easier to follow. 
   
   

Common Uses For An Elevator

- Calling the elevator
- Choosing the floor
- Closing the door faster
- Holding the door open

Rare Uses For An Elevator
- Call operator
- Fire alarm button
- Emergency stop


Common Sequence of Action
1) First call the elevator on the outside panel
2) On the inside panel select your floor
3) If you see people coming click and hold the door open button
4) If you do not see anyone coming and are wanting to go faster hold the door close button


How Elevators Support Users In How To Make It Work
- Having symbols that indicate what each button does. 
- For example labeling a button 1,2,3,4 would indicate there are four floors one being the bottom and 4 being the top. As well as labeling a button with arrows inwards, that indicates that you will be closing the doors and outwords indicates that you will be opening the door


How Elevators Provide Feedback To The User
- Buttons will light up when you press them indicating that you are performing that function
- Sounds such as dings will indicate when you have arrived at a floor


Common Mistakes With The Current Design
1) If people are in a rush and just take a quick glance at the control panel they could select the wrong button at the bottom and unintetionally click an emergency button because of how cluttered and unorganized the bottom is.
2) A user may mistake which floor they are on because of how the layout of the buttons are. If they are on the bottom floor and they step into the elevator since they are next to each other and the lobby is located upstairs people could mistakenly click the number one button thinking that it is referencing the building from top to bottom.
